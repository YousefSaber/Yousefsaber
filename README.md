### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

* I'm an undergraduate Computer Engineering student.
* I'm a data enthusiast, who's currently enrolling in courses to develop my skills in Data Analysis/Data Science ğŸ“ŠğŸ“ˆ.
* My Github profile is the home for all of my projects have fun to view and discover it ğŸ˜ƒğŸ™‚.
* Currently my Profile includes projects and assignments in Data Analysis and others during my study in college but once I graduate this profile will be cleaned so many repositories will go **private** and I'll only keep only those projects the **big** ones that reflect my experience in Data Science.
* The changes will take effect within year once I graduate, I'm currently in the final and 4th year of my study in college.
